        <h2>🎯 The CinemaScore Algorithm</h2>
        
        <h3>How We Find the Best Content</h3>
        <p>Our proprietary algorithm combines critical acclaim with audience love to surface only the highest quality movies and TV shows from the last 12 months.</p>
        
        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>Quality Score = </strong><br>
            (Critics Score × 0.65) + (Audience Score × 0.35)<br>
            <strong>+ Bonus Modifiers:</strong><br>
            • Certified Fresh: +4 points<br>
            • Verified Hot: +2 points<br>
            • Score Consistency: +3 points<br>
            • Large Gap Penalty: -3 points (if audience exceeds critics by 30+)<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Minimum Thresholds:</strong><br>
            • Critics: 75%+ on Rotten Tomatoes<br>
            • Audience: 7.0+ on IMDB or 70%+ RT<br>
            • Released within last 12 months
        </div>
        
        <h3>Why This Formula?</h3>
        <p><strong>65% Critic Weight:</strong> Professional critics evaluate technical merit, artistic achievement, and storytelling quality with trained expertise.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35% Audience Weight:</strong> General viewers provide important perspective on entertainment value and accessibility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Gap Penalty:</strong> Films where audience scores vastly exceed critical scores often indicate populist appeal without artistic merit, receiving a small penalty.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bonus System:</strong> Special achievements like "Certified Fresh" status indicate exceptional quality consensus, earning extra points.</p>
        
        <h3>Quality Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Only content scoring 83+ on our scale makes it into the loot box. This ensures you're discovering truly exceptional entertainment based on critical and artistic merit, not just popularity.</p>
